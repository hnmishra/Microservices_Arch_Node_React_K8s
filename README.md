**The blog project is a microservices-based application that consists of several services, each responsible for a specific part of the functionality using async communcation with custom event.bus. The project is structured into multiple directories, each representing a different service or component. Here is an overview of the main components:**
Services

	Kubernetes Deplyment: event-bus-depl.yaml
5.	Moderation:
	Directry: moderatin
	Descriptin: A service fr mderating cmments.
	Key Files:
	index.js: Express server handling cmment mderatin.
	Dckerfile: Defines the Dcker image fr the mderatin service.
	Kubernetes Deplyment: mderatin-depl.yaml
6.	Query:
	Directry: query
	Descriptin: A service fr querying psts and cmments.
	Key Files:
	index.js: Express server handling queries fr psts and cmments.
	Dckerfile: Defines the Dcker image fr the query service.
	Kubernetes Deplyment: query-depl.yaml
Infrastructure
	Kubernetes:
	Directry: k8s
	Descriptin: Cntains Kubernetes deplyment and service cnfiguratin files fr each service.
	Key Files:
	psts-depl.yaml: Deplyment and service fr the psts service.
	cmments-depl.yaml: Deplyment and service fr the cmments service.
	event-bus-depl.yaml: Deplyment and service fr the event bus service.
	mderatin-depl.yaml: Deplyment and service fr the mderatin service.
	query-depl.yaml: Deplyment and service fr the query service.
	client-depl.yaml: Deplyment and service fr the client service.
	ingress-srv.yaml: Ingress cnfiguratin fr ruting traffic t the services.
	Skaffld:
	File: skaffld.yaml
	Descriptin: Cnfiguratin file fr Skaffld, a tl fr cntinuus develpment n Kubernetes.
Additinal Files
	Dckerfiles: Each service has a Dckerfile that defines hw t build the Dcker image fr that service.
	.gitignre: Specifies files and directries t be ignred by Git.
	k8s-Cmmands.txt: Cntains useful Kubernetes cmmands and ntes.
This prject uses a micrservices architecture with each service running in its wn Dcker cntainer, managed by Kubernetes. The services cmmunicate with each ther thrugh an event bus, allwing fr a decupled and scalable system.
